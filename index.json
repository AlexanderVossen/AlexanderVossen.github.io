Entrepreneurship is a cross-sectional discipline at its core, and my research perceives it at the intersection of strategy, marketing, and organizational sociology literature. Most recently, I have focused on how new ventures achieve optimal distinctiveness, i.e., how they handle the trade-off between simultaneously conforming to norms to appear legitimate and differentiating to appear novel and unique to realize competitive advantages. To handle this trade-off, I examine the role of cultural entrepreneurship, i.e., how entrepreneurs utilize cultural tools and elements, such as narratives or images, to convey information on their ventures and products. For empirical testing, I collect and analyze large-scale secondary data from publicly available online sources and process them with machine learning, such as image label recognition and natural language processing.\nSince 2023, I have been an Assistant Professor for Data Science and Entrepreneurship at Tilburg University and the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science. Before that, I held positions at the University of Siegen, RWTH Aachen University, and BI Business School in Oslo, Norway.

An excellent paper on this issue is Petersen (2009) which this post builds on. Most commonly, the bias results from either correlation between different time periods of a group (a group effect) or a correlation across different groups within the same time period (a time effect). While the former is often referred to as serial correlation, the latter is referred to as cross-sectional dependence.\nUsually, when you use a package such as plm you have two different options to choose from for both random effect and fixed effect models to account for the one, the other, or both: the individual (only the group effect), the time (only the time effect) or the twoways effect (both group and time effect). Although this seems easy right away, there may be situations where you cannot simply specify twoways effects (for example, if you intend to use the nested random effect model) or, more critically, in my opinion, one of the key assumptions of this approach is not valid: namely that both group and time effects are “fixed.”\n“Fixed” means that a group effect stays constant across all your time observations. This means implicitly that you assume that the impact of all the things you do not know or cannot measure for a firm is time-invariant, which is a strong assumption.\nThink about the following examples: Image you are interested in the money raised by start-ups in several funding rounds. It is well known that the pitch, i.e., the presentation, influences investors (Martens, Jennings, and Jennings 2007). The problem is that often you cannot explicitly measure how “good” the pitch was—you are usually not present and do not have a clear indication of how well investors received it.\nAs you have observations from multiple funding rounds, you usually would use a dummy for each start-up to control for such unobserved effects. However, that dummy does not change and stays the same across all funding rounds—even though a presenter’s performance at the respective pitches might vary enormously (think about either having a bad day or it may be even a completely different presenter in different funding rounds). Therefore, the “fixed” group dummy may be biased.\nFor the time effect, the situation is similar. For capturing time effects, you would use year dummies to indicate in which year the funding took place. Again this is “fixed”; in this case, this means that it is the same for all start-ups that looked for funding in a given year. Just think about the pandemic: How realistic is it that funding rounds in 2021 have been identical for a start-up that works on a covid vaccine and a start-up that works on a dating app (which no one can use in a lockdown)? These simplified examples show that such “fixed” time and group effects are a strong assumption.\nPetersen (2009) recommends an additional and possibly even superior way of addressing this issue: Clustering your standard errors for the time and group clusters. I used it for one of my projects, and I wanted to share a small function I wrote to quickly test if a group and/or time effect is present in your data.
